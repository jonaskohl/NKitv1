# NKit

Welcome to the NKit v1.4 code, provided as is.

It's a bit rough around the edges and could do with cleansing. This was planned to happen, but due to the code passing all the tests – the last taking 10 days – cleansing the code was deemed too much of a risk. Unit tests posed to be a challenge.

This code references a modified version of SharpCompress which has 2 If statements commented out to support split SOLID rars.
